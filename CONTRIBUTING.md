## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in OpenLift. This project sits at the intersection of safety-critical control systems and modern software, so we’re intentional about process and scope.

### Ground Rules (important)
- **No proprietary manuals/logs**: Do not submit OEM documentation, screenshots, service-tool exports, jobsite/customer data, or any materials you obtained under an NDA or employment restrictions.
- **Safety-first**: No code or docs that encourage bypassing safety chains, defeating interlocks, or unsafe testing on live equipment.
- **Be vendor-neutral**: Avoid OEM branding, part numbers, or claims like “works with X controller” unless it’s public, standards-based, and reproducible.

### Where to start
- **Issues**: File an issue with a concrete problem statement and acceptance criteria.
- **Docs**: Clarify architecture, compliance artifacts, or onboarding.
- **Simulator**: Improve traffic models, kinematics, and test scenarios.
- **Controller**: CANopen Lift (CiA 417) object dictionary modeling, HAL interfaces, determinism, and test harnesses.

### Pull requests
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Add tests or a reproducible simulation scenario when applicable.
- Document assumptions and safety boundaries.

### Licensing
Unless stated otherwise, contributions are accepted under the repository license. Some subcomponents may evolve to use different licenses; see the README’s licensing plan for the intended direction.
