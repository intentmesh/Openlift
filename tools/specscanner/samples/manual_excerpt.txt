DRIVE FAULT RESET
-----------------
When the VVVF drive reports a fault, the controller will inhibit motion until the
fault is acknowledged. To reset:
1. Ensure the car is stationary and doors are closed.
2. Press and hold the DRIVE RESET pushbutton for > 1 second.
3. Observe that the DRIVE READY lamp illuminates before requesting new calls.

DOOR OVERRIDE
-------------
If the hall doors fail to close within 10 seconds, the controller energizes the DOOR
OVERRIDE relay and reopens the doors. Technicians may bypass the override by
selecting SERVICE MODE and flipping the DOOR HOLD toggle on the COP.
